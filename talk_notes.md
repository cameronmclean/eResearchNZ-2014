Communicating and managing the ‘messy knowledge’ of biology wet lab
experiments.

Organising our knowledge of laboratory
experiments in ways that can be interpreted and shared by both human and
machine is desirable for leveraging computational tools to assist the
discovery, reuse, integration, and reasoning over our scientific
knowledge. Ontology
or workflow based tools are often employed to achieve such goals. The
successful adaption, reuse, or replication of a laboratory experiment
however,
requires the description and communication of more than mere ‘entities’
and ‘processes’
described by our current tools - it relies heavily on individual background
knowledge, situated understanding, and a design rationale that is often
specific to local contexts or laboratories. Communicating this ‘messy
knowledge’
in a structured way remains challenging, and we lack good tools to
describe and
encode these more pragmatic concepts. To facilitate the sharing and
integration
of laboratory knowledge in the real world, i.e., "at the bench", we
identify design patterns which offer an approach and vocabulary that can
extend
our laboratory descriptions with additional elements such as intent,
purpose,
and situational constraints. We report here on progress towards the
utilisation
of design patterns to capture and communicate such ‘messy knowledge’, and
we
demonstrate an approach for transforming traditional design patterns into
a more
formal and structured form that can integrate with ontologies or other
computationally based representations.cp

####Slide 1
How we can leverage digital communication and computing technology to improve the discovery, reuse, and reproducibilty of our knowledge for experimental biology.

My title here refers to the "messy" knoweldge of lab experiments - because I what I really want to focus on is the difference between actual laboratory practices - i.e.,  the work of _doing_ experiemnts, in contrast with the 'apperance of technical order' and the way we communicate and evaluate the work via documents... This gap can at times be perlious. 

####Slide 2
So the work I'm aiming to support mostly happens here... This is a typical laboratory setting, and in performing biology experiments, a researcher is deep in the 'mangle' of arranging materials and technical equipment, relying on theories about how things work and what is being investigated - and all of this occurs within a situated social context for a given lab or domain of research. 
You'll note that this not your typical computational environment ... there arent even any computers in this particular picture - but I'm interested in how we can use computers to support the "people procedures" of bench science.

So - of these procedures for biology experiments - the predominant way that we communicate and evaluate laboratory work is via protocol documents or the "methods" sections of journal articles. These lab protocols are written instrucutions that describe the sequence of procedures to follow in order to produce or reproduce a certain state or observation. And they typcially look like this....

The lab protocols we publish tend to be ideal-typical and say nothing about contingencies nor describe 'concrete' bench practices. 
This is well known to practicing scientists - so much so that it has become proverbial -

And more revealingly the popularity of the #overlyhonestmethods twitter hashtag makes light of the difficulty of benchwork.
